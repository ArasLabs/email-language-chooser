# Language Chooser for Sending Emails

The sample provided adds an action on the Part Item that will allow the user to send an email to the creator of the Part with details of the part. The action is a client action that takes user input, in the form of a "Language Chooser" so the user can determine what language to send the email in (Translated Emails must be provided by you).
